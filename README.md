There are a lot of RPLIDAR out there, in general you will have to follow the manufacturer instructions to have it running. Some times, some instructions are the same for different RPLIDARs. 

The LD14P claims it's a short distance 360ยบ LiDAR, whith 2-8Hz(default 6Hz), minimum measure distance of 0.1m, range of 6-8m dependig on if its black or white, support for ROS1, ROS2, Python routines that run on Ubuntu and Windows.
