    "The above image represent one of several pictures taken from a static camera and chess boards placed at different locations and orientations. So we need to know $[X_w^{(i)} Y_w^{(i)} Z_w^{(i)}]$ values. But for simplicity, we can say chess board was kept stationary at XY plane, (so $Z_w^{(i)}=0$ always) and camera was moved accordingly. This consideration helps us to find only $[X_w^{(i)} Y_w^{(i)}]$ values simply passing the points as (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), ... which denotes the location of points. In this case, the results we get will be in the scale of size of chess board square. But if we know the square size, (say 30 mm), we can pass the values as (0,0), (30,0), (60,0), ... . Thus, we get the results in mm. \n",
