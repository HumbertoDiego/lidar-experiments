    "There are a lot o ~~shit~~ cheap cameras out there, how far with stereo pair quality images we can go with them? The key factor is dataset quality, in math terms, we want a lot of good keypoints found between images stereo pairs and it's next frames. Making videos with all cameras at fixed positions in relation to one another is our goal here. We start presenting the cameras arragement:\n",
